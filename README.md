# CI-server

## Summary
The goal of this project is to implements a small continuous integration CI server. We use Github as our development platform and C++ as the language. The CI server only contains some core features of continuous integration like compilation, testing and notification.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.

## Prerequisites
The project requires CMake (version 3.2 or higher), C++ (14 or higher) and ngrok.

## Coding Convention
We are using Google's coding convention, which can be checked in <https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.github.io%2Fstyleguide%2Fcppguide.html&h=AT2XiASN4MX-S1GhI-633n8PHGloked6j2fKYiiv6y5c2PBS0TMbnFDcrM6pT0yvrIB0HXj-U8nHvuqz3X-aofZoRWVswCyYKkJd3WoeRnXEHyA_hMmR2HCCcbSG86i-GVQIqQ>

## Compiling

This is one way to compile the project on a linux/debian based machine while in the project dir.

First running cmake to construct a Makefile
```
ci_test$ cmake -B./build -H.
```
Secondly run the make file to create executables
```
ci_test$ make -C ./build
```
There are now executables in the build folder one of them should be unittest, example of a executable being ran.
```
ci_test$ ./build/unittest
```
